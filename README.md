Statistical Text Comparison Between 3 Detective Fiction Books From 3 Different Authors

We use 3 different detective fiction books from Gutenburg. We chose "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, 
"The Mysterious Affair at Styles" by Agatha Christie, and "The Works of Edgar Allan Poe, Volume 2" by Edgar Allan Poe himself.

We use only the text from first chapter in each book to simplify the data and store in a csv file called "books.csv" that provided on the hub.

We comparise each top words in any form, create wordclouds, do the TF-IDF Extraction, and also do classification using Naive Bayes classifier.
