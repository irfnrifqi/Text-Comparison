1;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions and that one particularly were abhorrent to his cold precise but admirably balanced mind. He was I take it the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer excellent for drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him and that woman was the late Irene Adler of dubious and questionable memory.;SACD
2;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment were sufficient to absorb all my attention while Holmes who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul remained in our lodgings in Baker Street buried among his old books and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition the drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still as ever deeply attracted by the study of crime and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity however which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press I knew little of my former friend and companion.;SACD
3;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;One night it was on the twentieth of March 1888 I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice) when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit and even as I looked up I saw his tall spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly eagerly with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me who knew his every mood and habit his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.;SACD
4;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;"His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad I think to see me. With hardly a word spoken but with a kindly eye he waved me to an armchair threw across his case of cigars and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.";SACD
5;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Wedlock suits you he remarked. I think Watson that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.;SACD
6;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Seven! I answered.;SACD
7;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Indeed I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more I fancy Watson. And in practice again I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.;SACD
8;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Then how do you know?;SACD
9;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;I see it I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?;SACD
10;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;My dear Holmes said I this is too much. You would certainly have been burned had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess but as I have changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane she is incorrigible and my wife has given her notice but there again I fail to see how you work it out.;SACD
11;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands together.;SACD
12;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;"It is simplicity itself said he; my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe just where the firelight strikes it the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence you see my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope I must be dull indeed if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.";SACD
13;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. When I hear you give your reasons I remarked the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.;SACD
14;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Quite so he answered lighting a cigarette and throwing himself down into an armchair. You see but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.;SACD
15;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Frequently.;SACD
16;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;How often?;SACD
17;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Well some hundreds of times.;SACD
18;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Then how many are there?;SACD
19;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;How many? I don’t know.;SACD
20;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now I know that there are seventeen steps because I have both seen and observed. By the way since you are interested in these little problems and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences you may be interested in this. He threw over a sheet of thick pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table. It came by the last post said he. Read it aloud.;SACD
21;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;The note was undated and without either signature or address.;SACD
22;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;There will call upon you to-night at a quarter to eight o’clock it said a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.;SACD
23;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;This is indeed a mystery I remarked. What do you imagine that it means?;SACD
24;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?;SACD
25;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;I carefully examined the writing and the paper upon which it was written.;SACD
26;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;The man who wrote it was presumably well to do I remarked endeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff.;SACD
27;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Peculiar that is the very word said Holmes. It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.;SACD
28;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;I did so and saw a large E with a small g a P and a large G with a small t woven into the texture of the paper.;SACD
29;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;What do you make of that? asked Holmes.;SACD
30;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;"The name of the maker no doubt; or his monogram rather.";SACD
31;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft’ which is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like our ‘Co.’ ‘P’ of course stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer. He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. Eglow Eglonitz here we are Egria. It is in a German-speaking country in Bohemia not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha ha my boy what do you make of that? His eyes sparkled and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette.;SACD
32;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;The paper was made in Bohemia I said.;SACD
33;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence ‘This account of you we have from all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains therefore to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes if I am not mistaken to resolve all our doubts.;SACD
34;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating wheels against the curb followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled.;SACD
35;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;A pair by the sound said he. Yes he continued glancing out of the window. A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case Watson if there is nothing else.;SACD
36;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;I think that I had better go Holmes.;SACD
37;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Not a bit Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.;SACD
38;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;But your client ;SACD
39;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Never mind him. I may want your help and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair Doctor and give us your best attention.;SACD
40;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;A slow and heavy step which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap.;SACD
41;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Come in! said Holmes.;SACD
42;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would in England be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand while he wore across the upper part of his face extending down past the cheekbones a black vizard mask which he had apparently adjusted that very moment for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character with a thick hanging lip and a long straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.;SACD
43;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;You had my note? he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. I told you that I would call. He looked from one to the other of us as if uncertain which to address.;SACD
44;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Pray take a seat said Holmes. This is my friend and colleague Dr. Watson who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?;SACD
45;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;You may address me as the Count Von Kramm a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman your friend is a man of honour and discretion whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.;SACD
46;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;I rose to go but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. It is both or none said he. You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.;SACD
47;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;"The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. Then I must begin said he by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history.";SACD
48;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;I promise said Holmes.;SACD
49;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;And I.;SACD
50;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;You will excuse this mask continued our strange visitor. The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.;SACD
51;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;I was aware of it said Holmes dryly.;SACD
52;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;The circumstances are of great delicacy and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein hereditary kings of Bohemia.;SACD
53;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;I was also aware of that murmured Holmes settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes.;SACD
54;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client.;SACD
55;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;If your Majesty would condescend to state your case he remarked I should be better able to advise you.;SACD
56;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;"The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then with a gesture of desperation he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. You are right he cried; I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?";SACD
57;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Why indeed? murmured Holmes. Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein and hereditary King of Bohemia.;SACD
58;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;But you can understand said our strange visitor sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.;SACD
59;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Then pray consult said Holmes shutting his eyes once more.;SACD
60;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago during a lengthy visit to Warsaw I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.;SACD
61;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Kindly look her up in my index Doctor murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes.;SACD
62;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Let me see! said Holmes. Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto hum! La Scala hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw yes! Retired from operatic stage ha! Living in London quite so! Your Majesty as I understand became entangled with this young person wrote her some compromising letters and is now desirous of getting those letters back.;SACD
63;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Precisely so. But how ;SACD
64;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Was there a secret marriage?;SACD
65;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;None.;SACD
66;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;No legal papers or certificates?;SACD
67;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;None.;SACD
68;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes how is she to prove their authenticity?;SACD
69;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;There is the writing.;SACD
70;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Pooh pooh! Forgery.;SACD
71;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;My private note-paper.;SACD
72;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Stolen.;SACD
73;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;My own seal.;SACD
74;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Imitated.;SACD
75;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;My photograph.;SACD
76;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Bought.;SACD
77;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;We were both in the photograph.;SACD
78;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Oh dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.;SACD
79;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;I was mad insane.;SACD
80;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;You have compromised yourself seriously.;SACD
81;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.;SACD
82;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;It must be recovered.;SACD
83;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;We have tried and failed.;SACD
84;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.;SACD
85;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;She will not sell.;SACD
86;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Stolen then.;SACD
87;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result.;SACD
88;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;No sign of it?;SACD
89;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Absolutely none.;SACD
90;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Holmes laughed. It is quite a pretty little problem said he.;SACD
91;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;But a very serious one to me returned the King reproachfully.;SACD
92;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Very indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?;SACD
93;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;To ruin me.;SACD
94;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;But how?;SACD
95;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;I am about to be married.;SACD
96;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;So I have heard.;SACD
97;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.;SACD
98;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;And Irene Adler?;SACD
99;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman there are no lengths to which she would not go none.;SACD
100;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;You are sure that she has not sent it yet?;SACD
101;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;I am sure.;SACD
102;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;And why?;SACD
103;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.;SACD
104;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Oh then we have three days yet said Holmes with a yawn. That is very fortunate as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will of course stay in London for the present?;SACD
105;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm.;SACD
106;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.;SACD
107;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.;SACD
108;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Then as to money?;SACD
109;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;You have carte blanche.;SACD
110;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Absolutely?;SACD
111;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph.;SACD
112;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;And for present expenses?;SACD
113;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table.;SACD
114;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes he said.;SACD
115;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him.;SACD
116;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;And Mademoiselle’s address? he asked.;SACD
117;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Is Briony Lodge Serpentine Avenue St. John’s Wood.;SACD
118;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Holmes took a note of it. One other question said he. Was the photograph a cabinet?;SACD
119;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;It was.;SACD
120;The Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes;Then good-night your Majesty and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night Watson he added as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o’clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you.;SACD
121;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;The intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the time as The Styles Case has now somewhat subsided. Nevertheless in view of the world-wide notoriety which attended it I have been asked both by my friend Poirot and the family themselves to write an account of the whole story. This we trust will effectually silence the sensational rumours which still persist.;AC
122;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;I will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my being connected with the affair.;AC
123;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;"I had been invalided home from the Front; and after spending some months in a rather depressing Convalescent Home was given a month’s sick leave. Having no near relations or friends I was trying to make up my mind what to do when I ran across John Cavendish. I had seen very little of him for some years. Indeed I had never known him particularly well. He was a good fifteen years my senior for one thing though he hardly looked his forty-five years. As a boy though I had often stayed at Styles his mother’s place in Essex.";AC
124;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;We had a good yarn about old times and it ended in his inviting me down to Styles to spend my leave there.;AC
125;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;The mater will be delighted to see you again after all those years he added.;AC
126;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Your mother keeps well? I asked.;AC
127;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Oh yes. I suppose you know that she has married again?;AC
128;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;I am afraid I showed my surprise rather plainly. Mrs. Cavendish who had married John’s father when he was a widower with two sons had been a handsome woman of middle-age as I remembered her. She certainly could not be a day less than seventy now. I recalled her as an energetic autocratic personality somewhat inclined to charitable and social notoriety with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the Lady Bountiful. She was a most generous woman and possessed a considerable fortune of her own.;AC
129;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;"Their country-place Styles Court had been purchased by Mr. Cavendish early in their married life. He had been completely under his wife’s ascendancy so much so that on dying he left the place to her for her lifetime as well as the larger part of his income; an arrangement that was distinctly unfair to his two sons. Their step-mother however had always been most generous to them; indeed they were so young at the time of their father’s remarriage that they always thought of her as their own mother.";AC
130;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;"Lawrence the younger had been a delicate youth. He had qualified as a doctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine and lived at home while pursuing literary ambitions; though his verses never had any marked success.";AC
131;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;John practised for some time as a barrister but had finally settled down to the more congenial life of a country squire. He had married two years ago and had taken his wife to live at Styles though I entertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother to increase his allowance which would have enabled him to have a home of his own. Mrs. Cavendish however was a lady who liked to make her own plans and expected other people to fall in with them and in this case she certainly had the whip hand namely: the purse strings.;AC
132;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;John noticed my surprise at the news of his mother’s remarriage and smiled rather ruefully.;AC
133;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Rotten little bounder too! he said savagely. I can tell you Hastings it’s making life jolly difficult for us. As for Evie you remember Evie?;AC
134;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;No.;AC
135;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Oh I suppose she was after your time. She’s the mater’s factotum companion Jack of all trades! A great sport old Evie! Not precisely young and beautiful but as game as they make them.;AC
136;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;You were going to say  ?;AC
137;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Oh this fellow! He turned up from nowhere on the pretext of being a second cousin or something of Evie’s though she didn’t seem particularly keen to acknowledge the relationship. The fellow is an absolute outsider anyone can see that. He’s got a great black beard and wears patent leather boots in all weathers! But the mater cottoned to him at once took him on as secretary you know how she’s always running a hundred societies?;AC
138;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;I nodded.;AC
139;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;"Well of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands. No doubt the fellow was very useful to her. But you could have knocked us all down with a feather when three months ago she suddenly announced that she and Alfred were engaged! The fellow must be at least twenty years younger than she is! It’s simply bare-faced fortune hunting; but there you are she is her own mistress and she’s married him.";AC
140;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;It must be a difficult situation for you all.;AC
141;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Difficult! It’s damnable!;AC
142;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Thus it came about that three days later I descended from the train at Styles St. Mary an absurd little station with no apparent reason for existence perched up in the midst of green fields and country lanes. John Cavendish was waiting on the platform and piloted me out to the car.;AC
143;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Got a drop or two of petrol still you see he remarked. Mainly owing to the mater’s activities.;AC
144;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;The village of Styles St. Mary was situated about two miles from the little station and Styles Court lay a mile the other side of it. It was a still warm day in early July. As one looked out over the flat Essex country lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun it seemed almost impossible to believe that not so very far away a great war was running its appointed course. I felt I had suddenly strayed into another world. As we turned in at the lodge gates John said:;AC
145;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;I’m afraid you’ll find it very quiet down here Hastings.;AC
146;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;My dear fellow that’s just what I want.;AC
147;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Oh it’s pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life. I drill with the volunteers twice a week and lend a hand at the farms. My wife works regularly ‘on the land’. She is up at five every morning to milk and keeps at it steadily until lunchtime. It’s a jolly good life taking it all round if it weren’t for that fellow Alfred Inglethorp! He checked the car suddenly and glanced at his watch. I wonder if we’ve time to pick up Cynthia. No she’ll have started from the hospital by now.;AC
148;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Cynthia! That’s not your wife?;AC
149;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;No Cynthia is a protegee of my mother’s the daughter of an old schoolfellow of hers who married a rascally solicitor. He came a cropper and the girl was left an orphan and penniless. My mother came to the rescue and Cynthia has been with us nearly two years now. She works in the Red Cross Hospital at Tadminster seven miles away.;AC
150;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;As he spoke the last words we drew up in front of the fine old house. A lady in a stout tweed skirt who was bending over a flower bed straightened herself at our approach.;AC
151;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Hullo Evie here’s our wounded hero! Mr. Hastings Miss Howard.;AC
152;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Miss Howard shook hands with a hearty almost painful grip. I had an impression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face. She was a pleasant-looking woman of about forty with a deep voice almost manly in its stentorian tones and had a large sensible square body with feet to match these last encased in good thick boots. Her conversation I soon found was couched in the telegraphic style.;AC
153;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Weeds grow like house afire. Can’t keep even with ’em. Shall press you in. Better be careful.;AC
154;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;I’m sure I shall be only too delighted to make myself useful I responded.;AC
155;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Don’t say it. Never does. Wish you hadn’t later.;AC
156;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;You’re a cynic Evie said John laughing. Where’s tea to-day inside or out?;AC
157;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Out. Too fine a day to be cooped up in the house.;AC
158;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Come on then you’ve done enough gardening for to-day. ‘The labourer is worthy of his hire’ you know. Come and be refreshed.;AC
159;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Well said Miss Howard drawing off her gardening gloves I’m inclined to agree with you.;AC
160;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;She led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade of a large sycamore.;AC
161;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;A figure rose from one of the basket chairs and came a few steps to meet us.;AC
162;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;My wife Hastings said John.;AC
163;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;"I shall never forget my first sight of Mary Cavendish. Her tall slender form outlined against the bright light; the vivid sense of slumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful tawny eyes of hers remarkable eyes different from any other woman’s that I have ever known; the intense power of stillness she possessed which nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in an exquisitely civilised body all these things are burnt into my memory. I shall never forget them.";AC
164;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;She greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear voice and I sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that I had accepted John’s invitation. Mrs. Cavendish gave me some tea and her few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a thoroughly fascinating woman. An appreciative listener is always stimulating and I described in a humorous manner certain incidents of my Convalescent Home in a way which I flatter myself greatly amused my hostess. John of course good fellow though he is could hardly be called a brilliant conversationalist.;AC
165;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;At that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open French window near at hand:;AC
166;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Then you’ll write to the Princess after tea Alfred? I’ll write to Lady Tadminster for the second day myself. Or shall we wait until we hear from the Princess? In case of a refusal Lady Tadminster might open it the first day and Mrs. Crosbie the second. Then there’s the Duchess about the school fête.;AC
167;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;There was the murmur of a man’s voice and then Mrs. Inglethorp’s rose in reply:;AC
168;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Yes certainly. After tea will do quite well. You are so thoughtful Alfred dear.;AC
169;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;The French window swung open a little wider and a handsome white-haired old lady with a somewhat masterful cast of features stepped out of it on to the lawn. A man followed her a suggestion of deference in his manner.;AC
170;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Mrs. Inglethorp greeted me with effusion.;AC
171;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Why if it isn’t too delightful to see you again Mr. Hastings after all these years. Alfred darling Mr. Hastings my husband.;AC
172;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;I looked with some curiosity at Alfred darling. He certainly struck a rather alien note. I did not wonder at John objecting to his beard. It was one of the longest and blackest I have ever seen. He wore gold-rimmed pince-nez and had a curious impassivity of feature. It struck me that he might look natural on a stage but was strangely out of place in real life. His voice was rather deep and unctuous. He placed a wooden hand in mine and said:;AC
173;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;This is a pleasure Mr. Hastings. Then turning to his wife: Emily dearest I think that cushion is a little damp.;AC
174;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;She beamed fondly on him as he substituted another with every demonstration of the tenderest care. Strange infatuation of an otherwise sensible woman!;AC
175;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;With the presence of Mr. Inglethorp a sense of constraint and veiled hostility seemed to settle down upon the company. Miss Howard in particular took no pains to conceal her feelings. Mrs. Inglethorp however seemed to notice nothing unusual. Her volubility which I remembered of old had lost nothing in the intervening years and she poured out a steady flood of conversation mainly on the subject of the forthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place shortly. Occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of days or dates. His watchful and attentive manner never varied. From the very first I took a firm and rooted dislike to him and I flatter myself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd.;AC
176;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Presently Mrs. Inglethorp turned to give some instructions about letters to Evelyn Howard and her husband addressed me in his painstaking voice:;AC
177;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Is soldiering your regular profession Mr. Hastings?;AC
178;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;No before the war I was in Lloyd’s.;AC
179;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;And you will return there after it is over?;AC
180;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Perhaps. Either that or a fresh start altogether.;AC
181;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Mary Cavendish leant forward.;AC
182;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;What would you really choose as a profession if you could just consult your inclination?;AC
183;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Well that depends.;AC
184;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;No secret hobby? she asked. Tell me you’re drawn to something? Everyone is usually something absurd.;AC
185;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;You’ll laugh at me.;AC
186;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;She smiled.;AC
187;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Perhaps.;AC
188;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Well I’ve always had a secret hankering to be a detective!;AC
189;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;The real thing Scotland Yard? Or Sherlock Holmes?;AC
190;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Oh Sherlock Holmes by all means. But really seriously I am awfully drawn to it. I came across a man in Belgium once a very famous detective and he quite inflamed me. He was a marvellous little fellow. He used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of method. My system is based on his though of course I have progressed rather further. He was a funny little man a great dandy but wonderfully clever.;AC
191;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Like a good detective story myself remarked Miss Howard. Lots of nonsense written though. Criminal discovered in last chapter. Everyone dumbfounded. Real crime you’d know at once.;AC
192;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;There have been a great number of undiscovered crimes I argued.;AC
193;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Don’t mean the police but the people that are right in it. The family. You couldn’t really hoodwink them. They’d know.;AC
194;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Then I said much amused you think that if you were mixed up in a crime say a murder you’d be able to spot the murderer right off?;AC
195;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Of course I should. Mightn’t be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers. But I’m certain I’d know. I’d feel it in my fingertips if he came near me.;AC
196;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;It might be a ‘she’ I suggested.;AC
197;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Might. But murder’s a violent crime. Associate it more with a man.;AC
198;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Not in a case of poisoning. Mrs. Cavendish’s clear voice startled me. Dr. Bauerstein was saying yesterday that owing to the general ignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession there were probably countless cases of poisoning quite unsuspected.;AC
199;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Why Mary what a gruesome conversation! cried Mrs. Inglethorp. It makes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave. Oh there’s Cynthia!;AC
200;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;A young girl in V.A.D. uniform ran lightly across the lawn.;AC
201;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Why Cynthia you are late to-day. This is Mr. Hastings Miss Murdoch.;AC
202;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Cynthia Murdoch was a fresh-looking young creature full of life and vigour. She tossed off her little V.A.D. cap and I admired the great loose waves of her auburn hair and the smallness and whiteness of the hand she held out to claim her tea. With dark eyes and eyelashes she would have been a beauty.;AC
203;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;She flung herself down on the ground beside John and as I handed her a plate of sandwiches she smiled up at me.;AC
204;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Sit down here on the grass do. It’s ever so much nicer.;AC
205;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;I dropped down obediently.;AC
206;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;You work at Tadminster don’t you Miss Murdoch?;AC
207;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;She nodded.;AC
208;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;For my sins.;AC
209;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Do they bully you then? I asked smiling.;AC
210;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;I should like to see them! cried Cynthia with dignity.;AC
211;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;I have got a cousin who is nursing I remarked. And she is terrified of ‘Sisters’.;AC
212;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;I don’t wonder. Sisters are you know Mr. Hastings. They simp-ly are! You’ve no idea! But I’m not a nurse thank heaven I work in the dispensary.;AC
213;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;How many people do you poison? I asked smiling.;AC
214;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Cynthia smiled too.;AC
215;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Oh hundreds! she said.;AC
216;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Cynthia called Mrs. Inglethorp do you think you could write a few notes for me?;AC
217;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Certainly Aunt Emily.;AC
218;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;She jumped up promptly and something in her manner reminded me that her position was a dependent one and that Mrs. Inglethorp kind as she might be in the main did not allow her to forget it.;AC
219;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;My hostess turned to me.;AC
220;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;"John will show you your room. Supper is at half-past seven. We have given up late dinner for some time now. Lady Tadminster our Member’s wife she was the late Lord Abbotsbury’s daughter does the same. She agrees with me that one must set an example of economy. We are quite a war household; nothing is wasted here every scrap of waste paper even is saved and sent away in sacks.";AC
221;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;I expressed my appreciation and John took me into the house and up the broad staircase which forked right and left half-way to different wings of the building. My room was in the left wing and looked out over the park.;AC
222;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;John left me and a few minutes later I saw him from my window walking slowly across the grass arm in arm with Cynthia Murdoch. I heard Mrs. Inglethorp call Cynthia impatiently and the girl started and ran back to the house. At the same moment a man stepped out from the shadow of a tree and walked slowly in the same direction. He looked about forty very dark with a melancholy clean-shaven face. Some violent emotion seemed to be mastering him. He looked up at my window as he passed and I recognized him though he had changed much in the fifteen years that had elapsed since we last met. It was John’s younger brother Lawrence Cavendish. I wondered what it was that had brought that singular expression to his face.;AC
223;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Then I dismissed him from my mind and returned to the contemplation of my own affairs.;AC
224;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;"The evening passed pleasantly enough; and I dreamed that night of that enigmatical woman Mary Cavendish.";AC
225;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;The next morning dawned bright and sunny and I was full of the anticipation of a delightful visit.;AC
226;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;I did not see Mrs. Cavendish until lunch-time when she volunteered to take me for a walk and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the woods returning to the house about five.;AC
227;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;As we entered the large hall John beckoned us both into the smoking-room. I saw at once by his face that something disturbing had occurred. We followed him in and he shut the door after us.;AC
228;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Look here Mary there’s the deuce of a mess. Evie’s had a row with Alfred Inglethorp and she’s off.;AC
229;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Evie? Off?;AC
230;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;John nodded gloomily.;AC
231;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;"Yes; you see she went to the mater and Oh here’s Evie herself.";AC
232;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Miss Howard entered. Her lips were set grimly together and she carried a small suit-case. She looked excited and determined and slightly on the defensive.;AC
233;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;At any rate she burst out I’ve spoken my mind!;AC
234;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;My dear Evelyn cried Mrs. Cavendish this can’t be true!;AC
235;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Miss Howard nodded grimly.;AC
236;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;True enough! Afraid I said some things to Emily she won’t forget or forgive in a hurry. Don’t mind if they’ve only sunk in a bit. Probably water off a duck’s back though. I said right out: ‘You’re an old woman Emily and there’s no fool like an old fool. The man’s twenty years younger than you and don’t you fool yourself as to what he married you for. Money! Well don’t let him have too much of it. Farmer Raikes has got a very pretty young wife. Just ask your Alfred how much time he spends over there.’ She was very angry. Natural! I went on ‘I’m going to warn you whether you like it or not. That man would as soon murder you in your bed as look at you. He’s a bad lot. You can say what you like to me but remember what I’ve told you. He’s a bad lot!’;AC
237;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;What did she say?;AC
238;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Miss Howard made an extremely expressive grimace.;AC
239;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;‘Darling Alfred’ ‘dearest Alfred’ ‘wicked calumnies’  ‘wicked lies’ ‘wicked woman’ to accuse her ‘dear husband!’ The sooner I left her house the better. So I’m off.;AC
240;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;But not now?;AC
241;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;This minute!;AC
242;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;For a moment we sat and stared at her. Finally John Cavendish finding his persuasions of no avail went off to look up the trains. His wife followed him murmuring something about persuading Mrs. Inglethorp to think better of it.;AC
243;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;As she left the room Miss Howard’s face changed. She leant towards me eagerly.;AC
244;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Mr. Hastings you’re honest. I can trust you?;AC
245;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;I was a little startled. She laid her hand on my arm and sank her voice to a whisper.;AC
246;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Look after her Mr. Hastings. My poor Emily. They’re a lot of sharks all of them. Oh I know what I’m talking about. There isn’t one of them that’s not hard up and trying to get money out of her. I’ve protected her as much as I could. Now I’m out of the way they’ll impose upon her.;AC
247;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Of course Miss Howard I said I’ll do everything I can but I’m sure you’re excited and overwrought.;AC
248;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;She interrupted me by slowly shaking her forefinger.;AC
249;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Young man trust me. I’ve lived in the world rather longer than you have. All I ask you is to keep your eyes open. You’ll see what I mean.;AC
250;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;The throb of the motor came through the open window and Miss Howard rose and moved to the door. John’s voice sounded outside. With her hand on the handle she turned her head over her shoulder and beckoned to me.;AC
251;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Above all Mr. Hastings watch that devil her husband!;AC
252;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;There was no time for more. Miss Howard was swallowed up in an eager chorus of protests and good-byes. The Inglethorps did not appear.;AC
253;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;As the motor drove away Mrs. Cavendish suddenly detached herself from the group and moved across the drive to the lawn to meet a tall bearded man who had been evidently making for the house. The colour rose in her cheeks as she held out her hand to him.;AC
254;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Who is that? I asked sharply for instinctively I distrusted the man.;AC
255;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;That’s Dr. Bauerstein said John shortly.;AC
256;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;And who is Dr. Bauerstein?;AC
257;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;"He’s staying in the village doing a rest cure after a bad nervous breakdown. He’s a London specialist; a very clever man one of the greatest living experts on poisons I believe.";AC
258;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;And he’s a great friend of Mary’s put in Cynthia the irrepressible.;AC
259;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;John Cavendish frowned and changed the subject.;AC
260;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Come for a stroll Hastings. This has been a most rotten business. She always had a rough tongue but there is no stauncher friend in England than Evelyn Howard.;AC
261;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;He took the path through the plantation and we walked down to the village through the woods which bordered one side of the estate.;AC
262;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;As we passed through one of the gates on our way home again a pretty young woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction bowed and smiled.;AC
263;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;That’s a pretty girl I remarked appreciatively.;AC
264;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;John’s face hardened.;AC
265;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;That is Mrs. Raikes.;AC
266;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;The one that Miss Howard  ;AC
267;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Exactly said John with rather unnecessary abruptness.;AC
268;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;I thought of the white-haired old lady in the big house and that vivid wicked little face that had just smiled into ours and a vague chill of foreboding crept over me. I brushed it aside.;AC
269;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Styles is really a glorious old place I said to John.;AC
270;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;He nodded rather gloomily.;AC
271;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Yes it’s a fine property. It’ll be mine some day should be mine now by rights if my father had only made a decent will. And then I shouldn’t be so damned hard up as I am now.;AC
272;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Hard up are you?;AC
273;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;My dear Hastings I don’t mind telling you that I’m at my wits’ end for money.;AC
274;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Couldn’t your brother help you?;AC
275;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;Lawrence? He’s gone through every penny he ever had publishing rotten verses in fancy bindings. No we’re an impecunious lot. My mother’s always been awfully good to us I must say. That is up to now. Since her marriage of course   he broke off frowning.;AC
276;The Mysterious Affair At Styles;For the first time I felt that with Evelyn Howard something indefinable had gone from the atmosphere. Her presence had spelt security. Now that security was removed and the air seemed rife with suspicion. The sinister face of Dr. Bauerstein recurred to me unpleasantly. A vague suspicion of everyone and everything filled my mind. Just for a moment I had a premonition of approaching evil.;AC
277;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"At Paris just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18- I was enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum in company with my friend C. Auguste Dupin in his little back library or book-closet au troisième No. 33 Rue Dunôt Faubourg St. Germain. For one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence; while each to any casual observer might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber. For myself however I was mentally discussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period of the evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue and the mystery attending the murder of Marie Rogêt. I looked upon it therefore as something of a coincidence when the door of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance Monsieur G   the Prefect of the Parisian police.";EAP
278;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man and we had not seen him for several years. We had been sitting in the dark and Dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp but sat down again without doing so upon G.‘s saying that he had called to consult us or rather to ask the opinion of my friend about some official business which had occasioned a great deal of trouble.";EAP
279;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;If it is any point requiring reflection observed Dupin as he forebore to enkindle the wick we shall examine it to better purpose in the dark.;EAP
280;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;That is another of your odd notions said the Prefect who had a fashion of calling every thing odd that was beyond his comprehension and thus lived amid an absolute legion of oddities.;EAP
281;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Very true said Dupin as he supplied his visitor with a pipe and rolled towards him a comfortable chair.;EAP
282;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;And what is the difficulty now? I asked. Nothing more in the assassination way I hope?;EAP
283;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"Oh no; nothing of that nature. The fact is the business is very simple indeed and I make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well ourselves; but then I thought Dupin would like to hear the details of it because it is so excessively odd.";EAP
284;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Simple and odd said Dupin.;EAP
285;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"Why yes; and not exactly that either. The fact is we have all been a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple and yet baffles us altogether.";EAP
286;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at fault said my friend.;EAP
287;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;What nonsense you do talk! replied the Prefect laughing heartily.;EAP
288;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Perhaps the mystery is a little too plain said Dupin.;EAP
289;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Oh good heavens! who ever heard of such an idea?;EAP
290;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;A little too self-evident.;EAP
291;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Ha! ha! ha ha! ha! ha! ho! ho! ho! roared our visitor profoundly amused oh Dupin you will be the death of me yet!;EAP
292;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;And what after all is the matter on hand? I asked.;EAP
293;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"Why I will tell you replied the Prefect as he gave a long steady and contemplative puff and settled himself in his chair. I will tell you in a few words; but before I begin let me caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy and that I should most probably lose the position I now hold were it known that I confided it to any one.";EAP
294;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Proceed said I.;EAP
295;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Or not said Dupin.;EAP
296;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"Well then; I have received personal information from a very high quarter that a certain document of the last importance has been purloined from the royal apartments. The individual who purloined it is known; this beyond a doubt; he was seen to take it. It is known also that it still remains in his possession.";EAP
297;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;How is this known? asked Dupin.;EAP
298;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"It is clearly inferred replied the Prefect from the nature of the document and from the non-appearance of certain results which would at once arise from its passing out of the robber’s possession; that is to say from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it.";EAP
299;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Be a little more explicit I said.;EAP
300;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Well I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely valuable. The Prefect was fond of the cant of diplomacy.;EAP
301;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Still I do not quite understand said Dupin.;EAP
302;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"No? Well; the disclosure of the document to a third person who shall be nameless would bring in question the honor of a personage of most exalted station; and this fact gives the holder of the document an ascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so jeopardized.";EAP
303;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;But this ascendancy I interposed would depend upon the robber’s knowledge of the loser’s knowledge of the robber. Who would dare ;EAP
304;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"The thief said G. is the Minister D   who dares all things those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man. The method of the theft was not less ingenious than bold. The document in question a letter to be frank had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the royal boudoir. During its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it. After a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer she was forced to place it open as it was upon a table. The address however was uppermost and the contents thus unexposed the letter escaped notice. At this juncture enters the Minister D  . His lynx eye immediately perceives the paper recognises the handwriting of the address observes the confusion of the personage addressed and fathoms her secret. After some business transactions hurried through in his ordinary manner he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question opens it pretends to read it and then places it in close juxtaposition to the other. Again he converses for some fifteen minutes upon the public affairs. At length in taking leave he takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim. Its rightful owner saw but of course dared not call attention to the act in the presence of the third personage who stood at her elbow. The minister decamped; leaving his own letter one of no importance upon the table.";EAP
305;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Here then said Dupin to me you have precisely what you demand to make the ascendancy complete the robber’s knowledge of the loser’s knowledge of the robber.;EAP
306;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"Yes replied the Prefect; and the power thus attained has for some months past been wielded for political purposes to a very dangerous extent. The personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced every day of the necessity of reclaiming her letter. But this of course cannot be done openly. In fine driven to despair she has committed the matter to me.";EAP
307;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Than whom said Dupin amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke no more sagacious agent could I suppose be desired or even imagined.;EAP
308;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"You flatter me replied the Prefect; but it is possible that some such opinion may have been entertained.";EAP
309;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"It is clear said I as you observe that the letter is still in possession of the minister; since it is this possession and not any employment of the letter which bestows the power. With the employment the power departs.";EAP
310;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"True said G.; and upon this conviction I proceeded. My first care was to make thorough search of the minister’s hotel; and here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge. Beyond all things I have been warned of the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect our design.";EAP
311;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;But said I you are quite au fait in these investigations. The Parisian police have done this thing often before.;EAP
312;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"Oh yes; and for this reason I did not despair. The habits of the minister gave me too a great advantage. He is frequently absent from home all night. His servants are by no means numerous. They sleep at a distance from their master’s apartment and being chiefly Neapolitans are readily made drunk. I have keys as you know with which I can open any chamber or cabinet in Paris. For three months a night has not passed during the greater part of which I have not been engaged personally in ransacking the D   Hotel. My honor is interested and to mention a great secret the reward is enormous. So I did not abandon the search until I had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more astute man than myself. I fancy that I have investigated every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be concealed.";EAP
313;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;But is it not possible I suggested that although the letter may be in possession of the minister as it unquestionably is he may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises?;EAP
314;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;This is barely possible said Dupin. The present peculiar condition of affairs at court and especially of those intrigues in which D   is known to be involved would render the instant availability of the document its susceptibility of being produced at a moment’s notice a point of nearly equal importance with its possession.;EAP
315;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Its susceptibility of being produced? said I.;EAP
316;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;That is to say of being destroyed said Dupin.;EAP
317;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"True I observed; the paper is clearly then upon the premises. As for its being upon the person of the minister we may consider that as out of the question.";EAP
318;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Entirely said the Prefect. He has been twice waylaid as if by footpads and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection.;EAP
319;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;You might have spared yourself this trouble said Dupin. D   I presume is not altogether a fool and if not must have anticipated these waylayings as a matter of course.;EAP
320;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Not altogether a fool said G. but then he’s a poet which I take to be only one remove from a fool.;EAP
321;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;True said Dupin after a long and thoughtful whiff from his meerschaum although I have been guilty of certain doggrel myself.;EAP
322;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Suppose you detail said I the particulars of your search.;EAP
323;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"Why the fact is we took our time and we searched everywhere. I have had long experience in these affairs. I took the entire building room by room; devoting the nights of a whole week to each. We examined first the furniture of each apartment. We opened every possible drawer; and I presume you know that to a properly trained police agent such a thing as a secret drawer is impossible. Any man is a dolt who permits a ‘secret’ drawer to escape him in a search of this kind. The thing is so plain. There is a certain amount of bulk of space to be accounted for in every cabinet. Then we have accurate rules. The fiftieth part of a line could not escape us. After the cabinets we took the chairs. The cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ. From the tables we removed the tops.";EAP
324;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Why so?;EAP
325;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"Sometimes the top of a table or other similarly arranged piece of furniture is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article; then the leg is excavated the article deposited within the cavity and the top replaced. The bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same way.";EAP
326;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;But could not the cavity be detected by sounding? I asked.;EAP
327;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;By no means if when the article is deposited a sufficient wadding of cotton be placed around it. Besides in our case we were obliged to proceed without noise.;EAP
328;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;But you could not have removed you could not have taken to pieces all articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention. A letter may be compressed into a thin spiral roll not differing much in shape or bulk from a large knitting-needle and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of a chair for example. You did not take to pieces all the chairs?;EAP
329;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"Certainly not; but we did better we examined the rungs of every chair in the hotel and indeed the jointings of every description of furniture by the aid of a most powerful microscope. Had there been any traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it instantly. A single grain of gimlet-dust for example would have been as obvious as an apple. Any disorder in the glueing any unusual gaping in the joints would have sufficed to insure detection.";EAP
330;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;I presume you looked to the mirrors between the boards and the plates and you probed the beds and the bed-clothes as well as the curtains and carpets.;EAP
331;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"That of course; and when we had absolutely completed every particle of the furniture in this way then we examined the house itself. We divided its entire surface into compartments which we numbered so that none might be missed; then we scrutinized each individual square inch throughout the premises including the two houses immediately adjoining with the microscope as before.";EAP
332;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"The two houses adjoining! I exclaimed; you must have had a great deal of trouble.";EAP
333;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"We had; but the reward offered is prodigious!";EAP
334;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;You include the grounds about the houses?;EAP
335;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;All the grounds are paved with brick. They gave us comparatively little trouble. We examined the moss between the bricks and found it undisturbed.;EAP
336;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;You looked among D  ‘s papers of course and into the books of the library?;EAP
337;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"Certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only opened every book but we turned over every leaf in each volume not contenting ourselves with a mere shake according to the fashion of some of our police officers. We also measured the thickness of every book-cover with the most accurate admeasurement and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope. Had any of the bindings been recently meddled with it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should have escaped observation. Some five or six volumes just from the hands of the binder we carefully probed longitudinally with the needles.";EAP
338;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;You explored the floors beneath the carpets?;EAP
339;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Beyond doubt. We removed every carpet and examined the boards with the microscope.;EAP
340;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;And the paper on the walls?;EAP
341;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Yes.;EAP
342;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;You looked into the cellars?;EAP
343;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;We did.;EAP
344;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Then I said you have been making a miscalculation and the letter is not upon the premises as you suppose.;EAP
345;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;I fear you are right there said the Prefect. And now Dupin what would you advise me to do?;EAP
346;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;To make a thorough re-search of the premises.;EAP
347;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;That is absolutely needless replied G  . I am not more sure that I breathe than I am that the letter is not at the Hotel.;EAP
348;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;I have no better advice to give you said Dupin. You have of course an accurate description of the letter?;EAP
349;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Oh yes! And here the Prefect producing a memorandum-book proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal and especially of the external appearance of the missing document. Soon after finishing the perusal of this description he took his departure more entirely depressed in spirits than I had ever known the good gentleman before.;EAP
350;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;In about a month afterwards he paid us another visit and found us occupied very nearly as before. He took a pipe and a chair and entered into some ordinary conversation. At length I said ;EAP
351;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Well but G   what of the purloined letter? I presume you have at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the Minister?;EAP
352;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"Confound him say I yes; I made the re-examination however as Dupin suggested but it was all labor lost as I knew it would be.";EAP
353;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;How much was the reward offered did you say? asked Dupin.;EAP
354;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"Why a very great deal a very liberal reward I don’t like to say how much precisely; but one thing I will say that I wouldn’t mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could obtain me that letter. The fact is it is becoming of more and more importance every day; and the reward has been lately doubled. If it were trebled however I could do no more than I have done.";EAP
355;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Why yes said Dupin drawlingly between the whiffs of his meerschaum I really think G   you have not exerted yourself to the utmost in this matter. You might do a little more I think eh?;EAP
356;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;How? in what way?;EAP
357;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Why puff puff you might puff puff employ counsel in the matter eh? puff puff puff. Do you remember the story they tell of Abernethy?;EAP
358;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"No; hang Abernethy!";EAP
359;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;To be sure! hang him and welcome. But once upon a time a certain rich miser conceived the design of spunging upon this Abernethy for a medical opinion. Getting up for this purpose an ordinary conversation in a private company he insinuated his case to the physician as that of an imaginary individual.;EAP
360;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"‘We will suppose’ said the miser ‘that his symptoms are such and such; now doctor what would you have directed him to take?’";EAP
361;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;‘Take!’ said Abernethy ‘why take advice to be sure.’;EAP
362;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;But said the Prefect a little discomposed I am perfectly willing to take advice and to pay for it. I would really give fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter.;EAP
363;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;In that case replied Dupin opening a drawer and producing a check-book you may as well fill me up a check for the amount mentioned. When you have signed it I will hand you the letter.;EAP
364;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"I was astounded. The Prefect appeared absolutely thunder-stricken. For some minutes he remained speechless and motionless looking incredulously at my friend with open mouth and eyes that seemed starting from their sockets; then apparently recovering himself in some measure he seized a pen and after several pauses and vacant stares finally filled up and signed a check for fifty thousand francs and handed it across the table to Dupin. The latter examined it carefully and deposited it in his pocket-book; then unlocking an escritoire took thence a letter and gave it to the Prefect. This functionary grasped it in a perfect agony of joy opened it with a trembling hand cast a rapid glance at its contents and then scrambling and struggling to the door rushed at length unceremoniously from the room and from the house without having uttered a syllable since Dupin had requested him to fill up the check.";EAP
365;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;When he had gone my friend entered into some explanations.;EAP
366;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;The Parisian police he said are exceedingly able in their way. They are persevering ingenious cunning and thoroughly versed in the knowledge which their duties seem chiefly to demand. Thus when G   detailed to us his mode of searching the premises at the Hotel D   I felt entire confidence in his having made a satisfactory investigation so far as his labors extended.;EAP
367;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;So far as his labors extended? said I.;EAP
368;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Yes said Dupin. The measures adopted were not only the best of their kind but carried out to absolute perfection. Had the letter been deposited within the range of their search these fellows would beyond a question have found it.;EAP
369;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;I merely laughed but he seemed quite serious in all that he said.;EAP
370;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"The measures then he continued were good in their kind and well executed; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case and to the man. A certain set of highly ingenious resources are with the Prefect a sort of Procrustean bed to which he forcibly adapts his designs. But he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow for the matter in hand; and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than he. I knew one about eight years of age whose success at guessing in the game of ‘even and odd’ attracted universal admiration. This game is simple and is played with marbles. One player holds in his hand a number of these toys and demands of another whether that number is even or odd. If the guess is right the guesser wins one; if wrong he loses one. The boy to whom I allude won all the marbles of the school. Of course he had some principle of guessing; and this lay in mere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents. For example an arrant simpleton is his opponent and holding up his closed hand asks ‘are they even or odd?’ Our schoolboy replies ‘odd’ and loses; but upon the second trial he wins for he then says to himself ‘the simpleton had them even upon the first trial and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second; I will therefore guess odd;’ he guesses odd and wins. Now with a simpleton a degree above the first he would have reasoned thus: ‘This fellow finds that in the first instance I guessed odd and in the second he will propose to himself upon the first impulse a simple variation from even to odd as did the first simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that this is too simple a variation and finally he will decide upon putting it even as before. I will therefore guess even;’ he guesses even and wins. Now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy whom his fellows termed ‘lucky’ what in its last analysis is it?";EAP
371;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;It is merely I said an identification of the reasoner’s intellect with that of his opponent.;EAP
372;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"It is said Dupin; and upon inquiring of the boy by what means he effected the thorough identification in which his success consisted I received answer as follows: ‘When I wish to find out how wise or how stupid or how good or how wicked is any one or what are his thoughts at the moment I fashion the expression of my face as accurately as possible in accordance with the expression of his and then wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart as if to match or correspond with the expression.’ This response of the schoolboy lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to Rochefoucault to La Bougive to Machiavelli and to Campanella.";EAP
373;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;And the identification I said of the reasoner’s intellect with that of his opponent depends if I understand you aright upon the accuracy with which the opponent’s intellect is admeasured.;EAP
374;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"For its practical value it depends upon this replied Dupin; and the Prefect and his cohort fail so frequently first by default of this identification and secondly by ill-admeasurement or rather through non-admeasurement of the intellect with which they are engaged. They consider only their own ideas of ingenuity; and in searching for anything hidden advert only to the modes in which they would have hidden it. They are right in this much that their own ingenuity is a faithful representative of that of the mass; but when the cunning of the individual felon is diverse in character from their own the felon foils them of course. This always happens when it is above their own and very usually when it is below. They have no variation of principle in their investigations; at best when urged by some unusual emergency by some extraordinary reward they extend or exaggerate their old modes of practice without touching their principles. What for example in this case of D   has been done to vary the principle of action? What is all this boring and probing and sounding and scrutinizing with the microscope and dividing the surface of the building into registered square inches what is it all but an exaggeration of the application of the one principle or set of principles of search which are based upon the one set of notions regarding human ingenuity to which the Prefect in the long routine of his duty has been accustomed? Do you not see he has taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter not exactly in a gimlet hole bored in a chair-leg but at least in some out-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg? And do you not see also that such recherches nooks for concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions and would be adopted only by ordinary intellects; for in all cases of concealment a disposal of the article concealed a disposal of it in this recherche manner is in the very first instance presumable and presumed; and thus its discovery depends not at all upon the acumen but altogether upon the mere care patience and determination of the seekers; and where the case is of importance or what amounts to the same thing in the political eyes when the reward is of magnitude the qualities in question have never been known to fail. You will now understand what I meant in suggesting that had the purloined letter been hidden any where within the limits of the Prefect’s examination in other words had the principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of the Prefect its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question. This functionary however has been thoroughly mystified; and the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the Minister is a fool because he has acquired renown as a poet. All fools are poets; this the Prefect feels; and he is merely guilty of a non distributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are fools.";EAP
375;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"But is this really the poet? I asked. There are two brothers I know; and both have attained reputation in letters. The Minister I believe has written learnedly on the Differential Calculus. He is a mathematician and no poet.";EAP
376;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"You are mistaken; I know him well; he is both. As poet and mathematician he would reason well; as mere mathematician he could not have reasoned at all and thus would have been at the mercy of the Prefect.";EAP
377;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;You surprise me I said by these opinions which have been contradicted by the voice of the world. You do not mean to set at naught the well-digested idea of centuries. The mathematical reason has long been regarded as the reason par excellence.;EAP
378;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"‘Il y a à parièr’ replied Dupin quoting from Chamfort ‘que toute idee publique toute convention reçue est une sottise car elle a convenue au plus grand nombre.’ The mathematicians I grant you have done their best to promulgate the popular error to which you allude and which is none the less an error for its promulgation as truth. With an art worthy a better cause for example they have insinuated the term ‘analysis’ into application to algebra. The French are the originators of this particular deception; but if a term is of any importance if words derive any value from applicability then ‘analysis’ conveys ‘algebra’ about as much as in Latin ‘ambitus’ implies ‘ambition’ ‘religio’ ‘religion’ or ‘homines honesti’ a set of honorable men.";EAP
379;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"You have a quarrel on hand I see said I with some of the algebraists of Paris; but proceed.";EAP
380;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"I dispute the availability and thus the value of that reason which is cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly logical. I dispute in particular the reason educed by mathematical study. The mathematics are the science of form and quantity; mathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity. The great error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called pure algebra are abstract or general truths. And this error is so egregious that I am confounded at the universality with which it has been received. Mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth. What is true of relation of form and quantity is often grossly false in regard to morals for example. In this latter science it is very usually untrue that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole. In chemistry also the axiom fails. In the consideration of motive it fails; for two motives each of a given value have not necessarily a value when united equal to the sum of their values apart. There are numerous other mathematical truths which are only truths within the limits of relation. But the mathematician argues from his finite truths through habit as if they were of an absolutely general applicability as the world indeed imagines them to be. Bryant in his very learned ‘Mythology’ mentions an analogous source of error when he says that ‘although the Pagan fables are not believed yet we forget ourselves continually and make inferences from them as existing realities.’ With the algebraists however who are Pagans themselves the ‘Pagan fables’ are believed and the inferences are made not so much through lapse of memory as through an unaccountable addling of the brains. In short I never yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that x2+px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q. Say to one of these gentlemen by way of experiment if you please that you believe occasions may occur where x2+px is not altogether equal to q and having made him understand what you mean get out of his reach as speedily as convenient for beyond doubt he will endeavor to knock you down.";EAP
381;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;I mean to say continued Dupin while I merely laughed at his last observations that if the Minister had been no more than a mathematician the Prefect would have been under no necessity of giving me this check. I know him however as both mathematician and poet and my measures were adapted to his capacity with reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded. I knew him as a courtier too and as a bold intriguant. Such a man I considered could not fail to be aware of the ordinary policial modes of action. He could not have failed to anticipate and events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate the waylayings to which he was subjected. He must have foreseen I reflected the secret investigations of his premises. His frequent absences from home at night which were hailed by the Prefect as certain aids to his success I regarded only as ruses to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police and thus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which G   in fact did finally arrive the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises. I felt also that the whole train of thought which I was at some pains in detailing to you just now concerning the invariable principle of policial action in searches for articles concealed I felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the Minister. It would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary nooks of concealment. He could not I reflected be so weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes to the probes to the gimlets and to the microscopes of the Prefect. I saw in fine that he would be driven as a matter of course to simplicity if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice. You will remember perhaps how desperately the Prefect laughed when I suggested upon our first interview that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its being so very self-evident.;EAP
382;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Yes said I I remember his merriment well. I really thought he would have fallen into convulsions.;EAP
383;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"The material world continued Dupin abounds with very strict analogies to the immaterial; and thus some color of truth has been given to the rhetorical dogma that metaphor or simile may be made to strengthen an argument as well as to embellish a description. The principle of the vis inertiæ for example seems to be identical in physics and metaphysics. It is not more true in the former that a large body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one and that its subsequent momentum is commensurate with this difficulty than it is in the latter that intellects of the vaster capacity while more forcible more constant and more eventful in their movements than those of inferior grade are yet the less readily moved and more embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress. Again: have you ever noticed which of the street signs over the shop-doors are the most attractive of attention?";EAP
384;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;I have never given the matter a thought I said.;EAP
385;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"There is a game of puzzles he resumed which is played upon a map. One party playing requires another to find a given word the name of town river state or empire any word in short upon the motley and perplexed surface of the chart. A novice in the game generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names; but the adept selects such words as stretch in large characters from one end of the chart to the other. These like the over-largely lettered signs and placards of the street escape observation by dint of being excessively obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too palpably self-evident. But this is a point it appears somewhat above or beneath the understanding of the Prefect. He never once thought it probable or possible that the Minister had deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the whole world by way of best preventing any portion of that world from perceiving it.";EAP
386;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"But the more I reflected upon the daring dashing and discriminating ingenuity of D  ; upon the fact that the document must always have been at hand if he intended to use it to good purpose; and upon the decisive evidence obtained by the Prefect that it was not hidden within the limits of that dignitary’s ordinary search the more satisfied I became that to conceal this letter the Minister had resorted to the comprehensive and sagacious expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all.";EAP
387;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Full of these ideas I prepared myself with a pair of green spectacles and called one fine morning quite by accident at the Ministerial hotel. I found D   at home yawning lounging and dawdling as usual and pretending to be in the last extremity of ennui. He is perhaps the most really energetic human being now alive but that is only when nobody sees him.;EAP
388;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;To be even with him I complained of my weak eyes and lamented the necessity of the spectacles under cover of which I cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the whole apartment while seemingly intent only upon the conversation of my host.;EAP
389;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;I paid especial attention to a large writing-table near which he sat and upon which lay confusedly some miscellaneous letters and other papers with one or two musical instruments and a few books. Here however after a long and very deliberate scrutiny I saw nothing to excite particular suspicion.;EAP
390;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;At length my eyes in going the circuit of the room fell upon a trumpery fillagree card-rack of pasteboard that hung dangling by a dirty blue ribbon from a little brass knob just beneath the middle of the mantel-piece. In this rack which had three or four compartments were five or six visiting cards and a solitary letter. This last was much soiled and crumpled. It was torn nearly in two across the middle as if a design in the first instance to tear it entirely up as worthless had been altered or stayed in the second. It had a large black seal bearing the D   cipher very conspicuously and was addressed in a diminutive female hand to D   the minister himself. It was thrust carelessly and even as it seemed contemptuously into one of the uppermost divisions of the rack.;EAP
391;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"No sooner had I glanced at this letter than I concluded it to be that of which I was in search. To be sure it was to all appearance radically different from the one of which the Prefect had read us so minute a description. Here the seal was large and black with the D   cipher; there it was small and red with the ducal arms of the S   family. Here the address to the Minister diminutive and feminine; there the superscription to a certain royal personage was markedly bold and decided; the size alone formed a point of correspondence. But then the radicalness of these differences which was excessive; the dirt; the soiled and torn condition of the paper so inconsistent with the true methodical habits of D   and so suggestive of a design to delude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the document these things together with the hyper-obtrusive situation of this document full in the view of every visitor and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which I had previously arrived; these things I say were strongly corroborative of suspicion in one who came with the intention to suspect.";EAP
392;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"I protracted my visit as long as possible and while I maintained a most animated discussion with the Minister upon a topic which I knew well had never failed to interest and excite him I kept my attention really riveted upon the letter. In this examination I committed to memory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack; and also fell at length upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt I might have entertained. In scrutinizing the edges of the paper I observed them to be more chafed than seemed necessary. They presented the broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper having been once folded and pressed with a folder is refolded in a reversed direction in the same creases or edges which had formed the original fold. This discovery was sufficient. It was clear to me that the letter had been turned as a glove inside out re-directed and re-sealed. I bade the Minister good morning and took my departure at once leaving a gold snuff-box upon the table.";EAP
393;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;The next morning I called for the snuff-box when we resumed quite eagerly the conversation of the preceding day. While thus engaged however a loud report as if of a pistol was heard immediately beneath the windows of the hotel and was succeeded by a series of fearful screams and the shoutings of a terrified mob. D   rushed to a casement threw it open and looked out. In the meantime I stepped to the card-rack took the letter put it in my pocket and replaced it by a fac-simile (so far as regards externals) which I had carefully prepared at my lodgings imitating the D   cipher very readily by means of a seal formed of bread.;EAP
394;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;The disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic behavior of a man with a musket. He had fired it among a crowd of women and children. It proved however to have been without ball and the fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard. When he had gone D   came from the window whither I had followed him immediately upon securing the object in view. Soon afterwards I bade him farewell. The pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay.;EAP
395;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;But what purpose had you I asked in replacing the letter by a fac-simile? Would it not have been better at the first visit to have seized it openly and departed?;EAP
396;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;"D   replied Dupin is a desperate man and a man of nerve. His hotel too is not without attendants devoted to his interests. Had I made the wild attempt you suggest I might never have left the Ministerial presence alive. The good people of Paris might have heard of me no more. But I had an object apart from these considerations. You know my political prepossessions. In this matter I act as a partisan of the lady concerned. For eighteen months the Minister has had her in his power. She has now him in hers since being unaware that the letter is not in his possession he will proceed with his exactions as if it was. Thus will he inevitably commit himself at once to his political destruction. His downfall too will not be more precipitate than awkward. It is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus Averni; but in all kinds of climbing as Catalani said of singing it is far more easy to get up than to come down. In the present instance I have no sympathy at least no pity for him who descends. He is that monstrum horrendum an unprincipled man of genius. I confess however that I should like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts when being defied by her whom the Prefect terms ‘a certain personage’ he is reduced to opening the letter which I left for him in the card-rack.";EAP
397;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;How? did you put any thing particular in it?;EAP
398;The Works Of Edgar Allan Poe Volume 2;Why it did not seem altogether right to leave the interior blank that would have been insulting. D   at Vienna once did me an evil turn which I told him quite good-humoredly that I should remember. So as I knew he would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the person who had outwitted him I thought it a pity not to give him a clue. He is well acquainted with my MS. and I just copied into the middle of the blank sheet the words ;EAP
